# password_generator
This is a password generator. It takes in the length that the password should be from the user (between 8 and 128 characters) and asks if the user wants to include lowercase letters, capital letters, numbers, and/or special characters, then generates a completely random password based on their selections and displays it in the password box. This program utilizes event listeners, functions, if and else statements, prompts, and confirms.
